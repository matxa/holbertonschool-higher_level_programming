Hello World Python

## 0. Run Python file

### Making an environmental variable

- python3 $PYFILE

  - python3 -> Is the code needed to run(exec) a python file.

    - $PYFILE -> Is a variable that holds the file name

  1. So to run this script we need to first set the `var PYFILE` equal( = ) to a file name
    `PYFILE=main.py`

  2. Now we can run the bash file 0-run (./0-run) this will run the main.py file.
    - `./0-run is` the same as -> `python3 main.py`
